# README Generator

  ## Description
  
 This project utilizes node and and the inquirer package to generate a README document for projects quickly and efficiently. I created this project to simplify the process of creating a README for future projects, as well as to trial my new knowledge of node js. Overall I'm happy with what I was able to produce. I still had some errors in getting the license links to work correctly, but am happy with my progress.
